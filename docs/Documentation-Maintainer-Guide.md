# Maintainer Guide

## How to change [docs/flux/flux-commands.md](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-documentation/blob/master/docs/flux/flux-commands.md)

The entries in [docs/flux/flux-commands.md](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-documentation/blob/master/docs/flux/flux-commands.md) describe the usage of commands used by flux.
flux-commands.md is fully automatically generated. To make this happen one has to
fill in the proper annotations in the correponding java classes. E.g.

```
reset-object-batch
------------------
- description:  Resets the downstream modules every batch-size objects
- options:      batchsize (int)
- signature:    Object -> Object
- java class:   org.metafacture.flowcontrol.ObjectBatchResetter
```

is generated by reading following annotations in [ObjectBatchResetter.java](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/blob/511b4af8b993c85a33d6a18322258a195684d133/metafacture-flowcontrol/src/main/java/org/metafacture/flowcontrol/ObjectBatchResetter.java):

```
@Description("Resets the downstream modules every batch-size objects")
@FluxCommand("reset-object-batch")
@In(Object.class)
@Out(Object.class)
```
The description of "options" is produced from all "public setter-methods", in this case:
```
 public void setBatchSize(final int batchSize) { ...
```
The option's name is produced by cutting away the "set" from the methods name, leaving
"BatchSize" which is then lowercased. The parameter of this option is generated from the
parameter type of the method - here an "int"eger.

## How to publish [docs/flux/flux-commands.md](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-documentation/blob/master/docs/flux/flux-commands.md)

If you have updated some of these annotations, say "description", and these changes are
merged into the master branch, generate a new flux-commands.md:
go to the metafacture-core repo, build a distribution and start the flux script by doing:

```
 cd git/metafacture-core # go to the mf-core repo
 ./gradlew metafacture-runner:signArchive # make a standalone distribution
 find . -name "metafacture-core*dist.tar.gz" # find the distribution
 tar xfz $pathToDst # unpack the distribution
 find . -name "flux.sh" # find the start script
 bash $pathToFlux.sh
```

Modify the generated output (i.e. the header), copy it to docs/flux/flux-commands.md and commit it.

Note that the example links to playground will only be generated if the "metafacture-documentation" repo is checked out and the file "linksAndExamples.tsv" is accessible via "../linksAndExamples.tsv" from the "metafacture-core" repo.

The [publishing process will be automated with an github action](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/issues/368).
