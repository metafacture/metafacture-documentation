# Metafacture Documentation

Metafacture is a toolkit for processing semi-structured data with a focus on library metadata
For the documentation see: http://metafacture.github.io/metafacture-documentation/

This repo is the central place for the documentation about Metafacture that we render using the jekyll template [Just the docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs).

The content pages can be found [in `/docs/`](/docs/)

## Installation
If you are on debian derivates go install build-essentials:
```
 apt install build-essential
```
Then you can use the Ruby Dependency Management to build all you need:
```
 bundle install jekyll
 bundle install
```
Start jekyll like this:
```
 bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Note
> [!NOTE]
> With regard to the Transformation-Modules this documentation focusses on Fix instead of Morph. If you want to find out more about Morph have a look at [the old documentation](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/wiki/Metamorph-User-Guide) and the german cookbook by [Swissbib](https://swissbib.gitlab.io/metamorph-doku/).

Our goal with this repo is to collaboratively create comprehensive documentation on Metafacture in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-documentation/issues?q=). Feel free to open issues not only for bugs or enhancements, but also questions about Metafacture usage, or to share your experiences. We hope that over time, in that way we can create useful tutorials, how-tos, and collect good practices for using Metafacture.
